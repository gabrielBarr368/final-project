			<h1 align="center">Welcome to the Glossary</h1> 
			
			<p>Legalize has some special terms that either aren’t present in regular English or are defined in a certain way that may be different from the way that the term(s) are used in English .  The purpose of this page is to try and define some of these terms so that the average person can understand them.</p>
			<h3><p>Perpetrator v. Defendant and Prosecution v. Defense</p></h3>
			<p>A person who has committed a crime is called the perpetrator.  There are two different sides in a court of law, the prosecution and the defense.  The prosecution is attempting to prove that the defendant committed the crime of which he or she is accused, while the defense is trying to prove that the defendant is innocent.  The person who appears in court for the prosecution is called the prosecutor while the person on trial is called the defendant.</p>
			<h2><p>American Terms</p></h2>
			<h3 id="#mentalStates"><p>Mental States</p></h3>
			<p>Under American law, there are basically four different mental states, intentionally, knowingly, recklessly and criminal negligence.  A perpetrator acts intentionally when his or her intent is to commit the crime.  If a perpetrator knowingly commits a crime then that means that he is aware that the circumstances of the crime exist but ignores them.  Recklessly refers to behavior where the perpetrator is aware that there is a substantial risk that if he or she continues with his or her behavior a crime will occur but continues anyways.  The decision to continue despite the risk has to be unacceptable by the standards of the community.  In other words, most people would view the circumstances and decided not to continue with their behavior.  Acting with criminal negligence is very similar to acting recklessly, except that the person fails to perceive the risk even though most people would.  Most laws require one of these four mental states.  The exception is what is known as strict liability offences.  A strict liability offence is one in which the mental state of the perpetrator does not matter.  Rather, the law is saying that if you commit the crime then you are guilty regardless of what the defendant was thinking at the time.</p>
			<h3 id="#Defenses"><p>Defenses</p></h3>
			<p>There are two basic types of defenses, a regular defense and an affirmative defense.  For most defenses the defendant will put forward the defense and then it is up to the prosecutor to disprove the defense.  For example, if we have a perpetrator who is on trial for murder, but claims that he or she was only acting in self defense then it is up to the prosecutor to prove that the defendant was not acting under self defense but in fact intended to murder the victim.  With an affirmative defense however this switches around the other way.  If the defendant claims an affirmative defense then it is up to the defendant to prove that the affirmative defense applies in this case.  An example of an affirmative defense would be if a defendant can prove that he or she had only three child pornography pictures in his or her possession and either tried to destroy them as soon as they came into his or her possession or reported the matter to the police promptly then the defendant is not guilty of violating section 2252 of Title 18 of the U. S. Code.  In this case, it is up to the defendant to prove this defense.  The prosecutor can remain silent on the whole issue of the defense and yet the defendant can still be found guilty.</p>
			<h2><p>Australian Terms</p></h2>
			<h3 id="#faultElements"><p>Fault Elements</p></h3>
			<p>Australian law has many of the same elements, but some of them go by different names.  Instead of talking about mental states Australian law talks about fault elements.  The basic idea though is the same, and there are still four different fault elements, intention, knowledge, recklessness and negligence.  A perpetrator acts with intention when his or her intent is to commit the crime.  If a perpetrator commits a crime with knowledge of the crime then that means that he is aware that the circumstances of the crime exist.  Recklessness refers to behavior where the perpetrator is aware that there is a substantial risk that if he or she continues with his or her behavior a crime will occur but continues anyways.  The decision to continue despite the risk has to be unacceptable given the circumstances that are known to him or her.  In order to prove that a criminal acted with recklessness the prosecutor can prove that the perpetrator acted with intention, knowledge or recklessness.  Acting with negligence is where the perpetrators conduct falls so short of the standard of care that most people would use in that circumstance that the conduct deserves to be treated as criminal behavior.  Again, most laws require one of these four mental states.  The exception is what is known as either a strict liability or an absolute liability offence.  A strict or absolute liability offence is one in which there is no fault element at all.  In other words, the law is saying that if you commit the crime then you are guilty regardless of what the defendant was thinking at the time.</p>
			<h3><p>Attempt and Conspiracy</p></h3>
			<p>Even if a perpetrator does not actually commit the crime, he or she can still be found guilty of an offense.  This is where the offences of attempt and conspiracy come into play.  Under Australian Federal law, a perpetrator is guilty of attempt if he or she attempts, or tries, to commit a crime.  In order for a perpetrator to be found guilty of attempting to commit a crime he or she has to have done more than simply prepared to commit the crime.  Rather, he or she has to take steps to begin to commit the crime.  Even if it would have beenn impossible for the perpetrator to commit the crime, it is still possible for him or her to be charged with attempting to commit the crime.  In addition, the perpetrator can be found guilty of attempting to commit the crime even if he or she actually did commit the crime.  However, a perpetrator cannot be found guilty of both committing and attempting to commit the same crime.  Any defenses that apply to a crime also apply to attempting to commit that crime.  Finally, the punishment for attempting to commit the crime is the same as the punishment for committing the crime.  In other words, if the punishment for committing the crime is three years in prison, then the punishment for attempting to commit the crime is three years in prison.  Conspiracy is when two or more people conspire to commit a crime that is punishable by more than one year in prison or a fine of at least 200 penalty units.  In order to be found guilty of conspiracy, at least two people have to intend to commit the crime, not just jokingly suggest it, and at least one person must commit an overt act to further the crime.  A perpetrator can be guilty of committing an offense even if the offense itself would have beenn impossible, the only other party is a body corporate or all other parties are either not criminally responsible or a person for whose benefit or protection the crime exists.  In order to extract oneself from a conspiracy a person must withdraw from the agreement and take all reasonable steps to prevent the commission of the crime.  Once again, all defenses that are applicable to a crime also apply to the charge of conspiring to commit that crime.  Finally, the punishment for conspiring to commit the crime is the same as the punishment for committing the crime.  In other words, if the punishment for committing the crime is three years in prison, then the punishment for conspiring to commit the crime is three years in prison.</p>
