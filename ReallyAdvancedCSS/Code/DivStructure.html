             <p>The city of Athens today is a mix of ancient ruins and modern architecture. 
			 The Greek people value their cultural heritage and struggle to preserve the ruins despite
			 economic pressures. A booming economy in post-WWII era resulted in a population shift from 
			 rural agricultural communities to the bustling city and stimulated a rapid construction of 
			 city apartment buildings in the mid-60's to early-80's. Many of the "housing boom" 
			 buildings are now falling into disrepair and are being torn down to be replaced with 
			 longer-lasting constructions.</p>

		<p>The Parthenon stands on a hillside on the edge of Athens. This view is looking back from the parthenon towards the
		   main part of the city.  In the foreground is a mound of stone which is where the people of city held
		   meetings to vote on decisions for governing the community -- a predecessor of our democratic principles. </p>

       <h2>Oracle at Delphi</h2>
       <p class="date">June 26, 2006</p>

	    <p>In the mountains, about a 45 minute drive from Athens, is Delphi. Delphi is where the oracle lived. An oracle
		is someone who can "reputedly" predict the future. Delphi was accessible via a river running through the mountains
		though today, we visit Delphi by bus or car.  During each year, thousands of people -- emperor, generals of the army, the wealthy -- visited the oracle for
		advice before going into battle, marrying, building a home, purchasing a service.  How could the oracle "see into the future?' There are hot spews in the
		mountains that spit out volcanic dust and fumes.  It is believed that the oracle would breath in the fumes and
		go into a sort of trance in which he would see the future and then provide advice to those who sought
		it. According to our tour guide, however, it is most likely that the people visiting Delphi gave the oracle information
		about what was going on in all parts of the civilized world. Thus, when a general sought advice about whether to attack another
		region, the oracle knew the current preparedness of that country for defense and could give good advice about
		whether the intended attack was going to be successful. </p>

        <h3>Parthenon</h3>
        <p>A pilgrimage to the Parthenon. I walked to the parthenon wistfully, wishing I could see it in its original 
		   glory.  It turns out that the Parthenon was actually a place to store valuables, especially those 
		   a conquerer might want to carry away.  The statues, particularly the statue of Athena, and carvings were in honor of the gods.
